# Process Review

Week 5 of Makers Academy.

This is a voluntary pairing session where I get feedback on my approach to TDD programming within 30 minutes.

## Exercise - Get the Middle Letter(s)

- The program runs in a REPL like `irb` or in a browser console.

- It's fine to use Ruby or JavaScript.

- Your job is to return the middle letter of a word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle letter. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 letters.

## Acceptance Criteria

```ruby
get_middle("test") # => "es"
get_middle("testing") # => "t"
get_middle("middle") # => "dd"
get_middle("A") # => "A"
get_middle("of") # => "of"
```

## Feedback

Positives: good use of IRB and steps taken to approach the problem

Rooms for improvement: Use Git and commit each passed test and write a README to give examples of input/output before starting to code. Start from the simplest problem
